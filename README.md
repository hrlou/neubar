# Neubar

The neubar project aims to implement similar functionality to the [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) music player.
FB2K is closed-source freeware, and can only be run on Linux under wine.
Other music player alternatives do not allow for the same customisability or eligance as I find FB2K strikes.
My goal isto create a music player which is just as customisable, that is free as in freedom.
